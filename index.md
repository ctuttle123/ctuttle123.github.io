# Hi, I'm Cedric Tuttle

🎓 **Economics & Data Science Senior at Carnegie Mellon University**  
📊 Currently a **Business Insights Analyst at Amica Insurance**  

Hi I'm Cedric, I’m passionate about using data to drive strategic decisions, build predictive models, and uncover insights that support innovation and initiative. I love learning about new platforms and tools that can enhance my productivity while also improving efficiency.
I have made this page so you can get a better idea of who I am! I have a few of my favorite projects you can check out at the projects page. I Love sports so I have projects arround the NBA, NFL and F1.
 My interest in data science really started with the movie Moneyball, I remember watching the movie at a young age and being amazed at what could be accomplished with data. We don’t always have the resources to make up for inefficiency and Data Analysis can help accomplish more with more limited resources which is true in sports but can also be applied to every single industry! I have also tackled projects around Insurance claims and Investments strategies to show the applications of my data skills in fields beyond sports!
